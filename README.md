# My Submission: CatCuddles
In this repo you will find my final fabulously well-documented submission of my project "CatCuddles", a web application design for crafty people (comme moi!) that want to create a colourful design and have it displayed through a visual LED lights (henceforth utlising a NeoMatrix 8*8). 
Although this project didn't turn out as what I had envisioned at the start, and it was also quite a process to create the link between Arduino, AdafruitIO and the Website itself. It was overall a fruitful project with many many takeaways. 

## CWIOT
1.The complete code for my project is organised within a dedicated folder named CWIOT. 

Under this folder you will find my Coding for Arduino in 2 files, 1 for Huzzah32 and 1 for the Config ( to establish the connection with the hotspot). 

### Schematic View
A schematic view of my project’s circuit involving 3 main elements, the Adafruit NeoPixel 8*8, the Huzzah32, and a connection the electricty (to power the LED lights).

### DWW
***Please note for best form of viewing the application please place the website view in width=412, and keep the same height ( so it can be viewed in the form of a mobile phone screen) 

#### Moodboard
--> Here you will find the original inspo behind "CatCuddles", and how it lead to the creative amazingness work of Picasso it is now.

Thank you for your time and viewing and hope the coding makes sense :)
