# My Submission: CatCuddles
In this repo you will find my final fabulously well-documented submission of my project "CatCuddles", a web application design for crafty people (comme moi!) that want to create a colourful design and have it displayed through a visual LED lights (henceforth utlising a NeoMatrix 8*8). 
Although this project didn't turn out as what I had envisioned at the start, it was a process to create the link between Arduino, AdafruitIO and the Website itself. It was overall a fruitful project with many many takeaways.
